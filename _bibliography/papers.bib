  abstract={This paper presents a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) FPGA architecture designed to perform processing of radio data in a streaming manner without interruption. The proposed architecture is evaluated for radio modulation classification tasks implemented on an AMD RFSoC 2x2 development board and operating in real-time. The proposed architecture leverages optimisation such as the General Matrix-to-Matrix (GEMM) transform, on-chip weights, fixed-point arithmetic, and efficient utilisation of FPGA resources to achieve constant processing of a stream of samples. The performance of the proposed architecture is demonstrated through accuracy results obtained during live modulation classification, while operating at a sampling frequency of 128 MHz before decimation. The proposed architecture demonstrates promising results for real-time, time-critical CNN applications.},

  abstract={Floating point Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) are computationally expensive and deeper networks can be impractical to deploy on FPGAs - consuming a large number of resources and power, as well as having lengthy development times. Previous work has shown that CNNs can be quantised heavily using fixed point arithmetic to combat this without significant loss in classification accuracy. We aim to quantize an existing CNN architecture for radio modulation classification to 2-bit weights and activations, while retaining a level of accuracy close to the original paper, for deployment on a Zynq System on Chip (SoC). To improve the development time for hardware synthesisable CNNs, we make use of MATLAB System Objects and HDL Coder. The PYNQ framework is presented as a practical means for accessing the functionality of the CNN. Our preliminary results show a high classification accuracy even with 2-bit weights and activations.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
