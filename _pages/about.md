I am currently writing up my PhD on the topic of "Deep Learning inference for PHY layer Wireless Communications applications on radio receivers", and working as a Research Assistant in the ![StrathSDR](https://github.com/strath-sdr) research group at the University of Strathclyde, Scotland and supervised by Dr. Louise H. Crockett and Prof. Robert W. Stewart.

My research and professional interests include: machine learning and deep learning, signal processing, embedded system design, FPGAs, RFSoCs, and wireless communications. I have a passion for learning new concepts and an enthusiasm for building efficient cutting edge designs.

I have taken part in three internships at MathWorks working as a Software Developer for the Wireless HDL team and one internship at AMD as a Software Developer for the PYNQ Research Labs team. I work as a freelance consulant at Neutral Wireless. I have deep experience in deep learning and AI through my PhD and heavy hands on experience with AMD embedded devices such as the AMD RFSoC.
