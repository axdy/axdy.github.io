I am currently writing up my PhD on the topic of "*Deep Learning inference for PHY layer Wireless Communications applications on radio receivers*", supervised by Dr. Louise H. Crockett and Prof. Robert W. Stewart. I am currently working as a Research Assistant in the [StrathSDR](https://github.com/strath-sdr) research group at the University of Strathclyde, Scotland. I also work as a freelance consulant at Neutral Wireless.

My research and professional interests include **machine learning** and **deep learning**, signal processing, embedded system design, FPGAs, RFSoCs, and wireless communications. I have a passion for learning new concepts and for building efficient cutting edge designs.

I have completed three internships at **MathWorks**, working as a Software Developer for the Wireless HDL team, and an internship at **AMD** as a Software Developer for the PYNQ Research Labs team. I have extensive experience in deep learning and AI through my PhD and hands-on experience working with AMD embedded devices, such as AMD RFSoCs.
