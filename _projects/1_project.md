# Do you have the GUTS? 2019

Our team took part in the Glasgow University Computer Science department annual hackathon. The even is sponsored by many high profile tech companies including: Amazon AWS, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Twilio, IBM, Verint, and Tennants :beer:.

## IBM Challenge
Develop a user application using the IBM Watson AI api.

## InTEXTicated
We won **1st place** in the IBM challenge :star:! This would have been our 3rd year attending. Previously winning 1st place in previous years' challenges.

Our app uses custom **Machine Learning** models trained with our handmade datasets to assist the user with sending messages. Based on your relation with the recipient, the app analyses the sentiment behind the message before altering the user. The app implements IBM Watson, Twilio, Flask, and statistical machine learning through Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).

## Code
Our code for the 3 day event, can be found here: https://github.com/leoreppas/GUTS2019. Rich with quick edits and ascii art.
